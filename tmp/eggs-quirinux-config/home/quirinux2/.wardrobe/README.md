# penguins-wardrobe

It is a repository mainly consisting of .yaml files and simple bash scripts used
by eggs to create customizations of Linux systems starting from a minimal
image - referred to as "naked" - to achieve a complete system.

It's too hard and long for me to have differents translation of this
documentation, so I decided to write it in italian and give just a translation
link.
